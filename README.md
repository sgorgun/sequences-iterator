Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), which allows to get the first n-numbers of the sequence. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield. Develop unit tests.

Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), which allows to get the first n-numbers of the sequence. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield. Develop unit tests.

Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [prime numbers](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE_%D0%AD%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0), which allows to get all primes up to some integer n. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield. Develop unit tests.
