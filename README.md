- Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), which allows to get the first n-numbers of the sequence. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield. Develop unit tests.
- Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), which allows to get the first n-numbers of the sequence. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield. Develop unit tests.
- Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), which allows to get all primes up to some integer n. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield. Develop unit tests.
