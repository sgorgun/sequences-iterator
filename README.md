Implement a method-generator of a sequence of [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), which allows you to get the first n-numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. Consider the possibility of counting a large number of sequence elements. Use block iterator yield.    
Develop unit tests.
